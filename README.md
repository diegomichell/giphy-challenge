# giphy-challenge

### For this solution I decided to use Redux, Redux saga for state management and React Native Elements for UI.

NOTE: You will see something weird, sorry, the first commits (the initial setup) before the challenge display my girl's name as she was logged in her git from my computer yesterday.
 The actual code for this challenge were commited with my credentials.
